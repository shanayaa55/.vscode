   <p>Hello my name is Shanaya Anderson. I am a mom of two. I enjoy taking strolls outside on sunny days and working out when I have free time. I have been looking for a career change and not just another job. That is why I am extremely excited to start this bootcamp and learn something new.</p>
   <h2>How I got my start</h2>
   <p1>When I first heard of coding I thought it was this really hard thing only people who were on a super smart genius level could do. My sister was interested in coding for a bit and she basically told me it was similar to learning a different language. I thought to myself learning another language is not easy but it is not impossible. I've been tired of just having a job. I want to have a real career. So I've decided to give something new a try, which is coding.</p1>
   <p2>I heard about Grand Circus from a coworker at work. He has friends that attended the bootcamp and have been successful at it and after. He also attended the workshop and is starting in November. I ended up going online and doing a little research. I spoke to some advisors, Ian and Ashlea, and made the decision to move forward with attended. I have not been this excited about working in a long time.</p2>
